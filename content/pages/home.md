## Welcome!

I study the cognitive mechanics behind episodic memory. Current experiments utilize computational models and behavioral assays. 

I graduated with a BA in Biology from Reed College, writing a thesis under Dr. Erik Zornik on the neurophsyiology behind the vocal behavior of Xenopus laevis. He joined [cMAP](http://people.umass.edu/cmap-lab/index.html) in 2014 as a lab manager, and and began graduate studies advised by [Rosemary Cowell](http://www.psych.umass.edu/people/rosiecowell/) in 2015.
